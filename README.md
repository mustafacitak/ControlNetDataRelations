# ControlNetDataRelations
Object Relationship Mapping using ConceptNet API
This project uses the ConceptNet API to query, classify, and visualize relationships between specific objects. With Python and various libraries, spatial and functional relationships are categorized and visualized. The project also includes a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for interactive exploration of the relationships.

Project Summary
Relationships between specific objects (e.g., "computer", "chair", "desk") are queried using the ConceptNet API.
These relationships are categorized as spatial and functional, and the strongest relationship is identified.
Using NetworkX and Matplotlib libraries in Python, these relationships are visualized as directed graphs.
The project also features a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.
JSON data retrieved from the API is saved as a separate file for each object.
